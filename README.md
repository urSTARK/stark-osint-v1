<!--![Stark OSINT CLI Banner]-->

A powerful, open-source command-line interface for conducting various OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) lookups. This tool streamlines the process of gathering public data, from vehicle details to image metadata.

___


# üåü Features

- Concurrent Phone OSINT: Combines public phone number tracing with checks against leaked databases.

- Vehicle Info Lookup: Finds vehicle registration, ownership, and other details from public APIs.

- IP Address Geolocation: Provides detailed geographical and network information for any IP address.

- IFSC Code Lookup: Retrieves bank and branch details for Indian IFSC codes.

- Image Analysis: Extracts hidden EXIF metadata (timestamps, camera model, GPS data) and performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to find text within images.

# üöÄ Getting Started

To get the tool up and running, follow these simple steps.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

- Tesseract OCR: This is a system-level dependency required for image analysis.
  

# On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
```

# On macOS (using Homebrew):

```
brew install tesseract
```

# On Windows:

- Download and install the Tesseract executable from [HERE](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Downloads.html). Make sure to add the installation directory to your system's PATH.

***install Tesseract executable is not necessary but if you want image analysis then it will required***
- **Installation**

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/urSTARK/starkosint
cd starkosint
```

2. Install the CLI tool using `pip`:

```
pip install 
```

This command will install all the necessary Python libraries and set up the `starkosint` command.

___

# üñ•Ô∏è Usage
***Run the tool directly from your terminal:***

```
starkosint
```

The CLI will present you with an interactive menu to choose your desired lookup type.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on API Keys
The leak database functionality relies on an API key. For security and privacy, do not hardcode your API key in the source code.

***It is highly recommended to use an environment variable to store your token.***

___

1. Set the Environment Variable:
On Linux/macOS:

```
export LEAK_OSINT_API_TOKEN="your_api_token_here"
```

***On Windows:***

```
set LEAK_OSINT_API_TOKEN="your_api_token_here"
```

---

2. Update the `starkosint.py` script:
Change the API token line to read from the environment variable instead of Colab's user data:

```
import os
API_TOKEN = os.environ.get('LEAK_OSINT_API_TOKEN')

if not API_TOKEN:
    print("Warning: LEAK_OSINT_API_TOKEN environment variable is not set. Leak lookups will not work.")
```
